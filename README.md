# GitHub RepoMonster

This script automates the process of creating multiple GitHub repositories from a predefined list of templates. Each new repository is named uniquely using a combination of random adjectives, animals, and timestamps to avoid duplication. The script logs the created repository names to a timestamped file for future reference or cleanup purposes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)

## Configuration

Before running the script, set the following environment variables:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token (for authentication).
- `ORG_NAME`: The name of your GitHub organization.
  
You can also adjust the script settings by modifying the following variables:

- `TEMPLATE_REPOS`: A list of template repositories available in your organization to base new repos on.
- `NUM_REPOS`: The number of repositories you want to create (default is 10).
  
## How It Works

1. The script selects a random template repository from `TEMPLATE_REPOS`.
2. It generates a unique repository name by combining a random adjective, animal, and a timestamp.
3. A new repository is created using the selected template.
4. The repository name is logged to a file named `github-repomonster-created-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt`.
5. This process repeats for the number of times defined by `NUM_REPOS`.

## Example Usage

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"
export ORG_NAME="your_org_name"
python github_repomonster.py
```

## Sample Output

```text
===============================================
ðŸ“¢ Starting Repository Creation
ðŸ“Œ Organization: your_org_name

ðŸ“Œ This file can be used for automated deletion process.
===============================================
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create repositories within the specified GitHub organization.
- The script includes a 1-second delay between repository creation attempts to avoid hitting GitHub's rate limits.
- The created repositories are private by default; you can modify this by adjusting the `private` flag in the `create_repo` function.

## Disclaimer

Be careful when running this script in production environments, as it will create repositories based on the templates you specify. Ensure that your GitHub organization is prepared for the number of repositories being created.
